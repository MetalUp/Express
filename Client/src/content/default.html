<p>In <b>Expression</b> pane on the left, you may enter any expression, simple: 
    
    <p><code>(3+4)/5</code></p> 
    <p>or complex: </p>

<p><code class="python">map(lambda x : x * x, range(1,10))</code>
<code class="csharp">Enumerable.Range(1,10).Select(x => x * x)</code></p>

<p>When you hit Enter, the expression will be evaluates and displayed in the <b>Result</b> pane. 
Don't worry if you have no idea what the second example means for now - try them both now.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cursor-up key will retrieve previous expressions that you have entered
<li>Cursor-down (from the last expression) will clear the field and enter a new one.</li>
<li>If you enter anything that is not a valid expression into this pane, it will be rejected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now click in the <b>Functions</b> pane. Here you may enter any 'pure' function: one that simply returns the value of an expression, 
    which will typically make use of values passed into the function as 'parameters', for example:</p>
    <p><code class="python">def square(a) : return a*a</code>
<code class="csharp">static int Square(int a) => a*a;</code></p>

<p>Type (copy/paste is deliberately not permitted) that function into the <b>Functions</b> pane, and hit <b>Submit</b>. 
If there are no errors, you will see 'Compiled OK' - if not, correct your code. You can then call use your new function from within the <b>Expression</b> pane, for example with:</p> 

<p><code class="python">square(3) + square(4)</code>
<code class="csharp">Square(3) + Square(4)</code></p>
