<p>Here is the complete code for two different ways to implement the function.  First, using Ternary operators:</p>

<code class="python">def willLive(alive, neighbours) : return (neighbours > 1 and neighbours < 4) if alive else neighbours == 3</code>

<code class="csharp">static bool WillLive(bool alive, int neighbours) => (alive ? neighbours > 1 && neighbours < 4 : neighbours == 3);</code>

<p>Alternatively, using only logical operators:</p>

<code class="python">def willLive(alive, neighbours) : return (alive and neighbours > 1 and neighbours < 4) or (not alive and neighbours == 3)</code>

<code class="csharp">static bool WillLive(bool alive, int neighbours) => (alive && neighbours > 1 && neighbours < 4) | (!alive && neighbours == 3);</code>

<p>Choose the one you are more comfortable with, re-type the code into <b>Function definition</b> and run the tests.</p>
