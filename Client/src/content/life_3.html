<p>The two functions previously written <code class="csharp">NeighbourCells</code><code class="python">neighbour_cells</code> and
        <code class="csharp">KeepWithinBounds</code><code class="python">keep_within_bounds</code> have now been added into the background code. 
        You can either call it from the <em>Expression pane</em> or from within any other function that you write. </p>

        <p>We are now going to combine these functions, applying 
                <code class="csharp">KeepWithinBounds</code><code class="python">keep_within_bounds</code> to <i>each</i> of the values
                of the list returned by <code class="csharp">NeighbourCells</code><code class="python">neighbour_cells</code>,
                returning a new list of integers that are all within bounds.</p>

        <p>Do this within a new function named 
                <code class="csharp">AdjustedNeighbourCells</code>
                <code class="python">adjusted_neighbour_cells</code>, 
                defining a single integer parameter <code>i</code> 
                and returning a list of integers.</p>
        
        <p>You can test the new function manually, in the Expression pane, for example applying it to the cell numbers for all four corners of the grid.
                When you are happy with it, run the tests.</p>
