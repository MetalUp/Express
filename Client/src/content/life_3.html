<p>The two functions previously written <code class="csharp">NeighbourCells</code><code class="python">neighbour_cells</code> and
        <code class="csharp">KeepWithinBounds</code><code class="python">keep_within_bounds</code> have now been added into the background code. 
        You use then in the <em>Expression pane</em> or within any other function that you write. </p>

<p>Write a new function named 
        <code class="csharp">AdjustedNeighbourCells</code><code class="python">adjusted_neighbour_cells</code>, 
        defining a single integer parameter <code>c</code> and returning a list of integers.</p>

<p>The function should apply
        <code class="csharp">KeepWithinBounds</code><code class="python">keep_within_bounds</code> to <i>each</i> of the values
        in the list returned by <code class="csharp">NeighbourCells</code><code class="python">neighbour_cells</code>,
        returning a new list of integers that are all within bounds.</p>

<p>You can test the function manually, in the <em>Expression pane</em>, for example applying it to the cell numbers for all four corners of the grid.
        Then run the automated tests.</p>
