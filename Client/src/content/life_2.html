<div>
<p><i>Life</i> is normally played on a grid that also wraps the top and bottom edges. 
        Your task is to simulate this, so that asking for: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>cell 400 would return the value of cell 0</li>
        <li>cell 401 would return the value of cell </li>
        <li>cell -1 would return the value of cell 399</li>
        <li>cell -2 would return the value of cell 399, and so on...</li>
        </ul>
<p>Write a function named <code class="csharp">KeepWithinBounds</code><code class="python">keep_within_bounds</code> that takes in an integer value named 
        <code>i</code> and returns an integer value that will always be in the range 0-399 as shown above. 
        It should work correctly for input values in the range -21 to + 420.
        When you have written and successfully compiled your function, run the tests.
        You can then apply this function to retrieving values from <code>grid1</code> by evaluating, for example <code class="csharp">grid1[KeepWithinBounds(403)]</code>
        <code class="python">grid1[keep_within_bounds(403)]</code>
</p>
