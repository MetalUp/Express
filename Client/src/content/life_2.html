<p><i>Life</i> is normally played on a rectangular grid that wraps the left and right edges, and also the the top and bottom edges. 
       The grid you are using already does the left-right wrapping. Top-bottom wrapping means that asking for: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>cell 400 returns the value of cell 0</li>
        <li>cell 401 returns the value of cell 1</li>
        <li>cell -1 returns the value of cell 399</li>
        <li>cell -2 returns the value of cell 398, and so on...</li>
        </ul>

<p>To achieve this we need a function named <code class="csharp">KeepWithinBounds</code><code class="python">keep_within_bounds</code> 
        that takes in an integer value named <code>i</code> and returns an integer value that will always be in the range 0-399 as shown above.</p>
       <p>It should work correctly for input values in the range -21 to +420.
        When you have written, and successfully compiled, your function, run the tests.
        You can then apply this function to retrieving values from <code>grid1</code> by evaluating, for example:</p>
        
        <code class="csharp">grid1[KeepWithinBounds(403)]</code>
        <code class="python">grid1[keep_within_bounds(403)]</code>

        <p>and checking that the return result corresponds to that of cell 3.</p>
