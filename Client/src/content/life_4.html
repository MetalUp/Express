<p><i>Keep function(s) from the previous task, and insert new function(s) above them.</i></p>

<p>The function written previously, <code class="csharp">AdjustedNeighbourCells</code><code class="python">adjusted_neighbour_cells</code>, has now been added into the background code. 
    You can call use it in the <b>Expression</b> pane or from within any other function that you write.</p>

<p>The next task is to determine, for a given cell, how many of its neighbours are alive. This will be needed (in a <i>subsequent</i> task) to determine whether a cell lives or dies in the next generation.</p>

<p>Write a new function named <code class="csharp">LiveNeighbours</code><code class="python">live_neighbours</code>, 
    which defines two parameters in the order given here:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A list of Boolean values, named <code>cells</code></li>
        <li>The cell number (an integer) of interest, named <code>c</code></li>
    </ol>
 </p>The function should return an integer representing the number of the cell's neighbours (out of 8) that are currently alive (have the value <code class="csharp">true</code><code class="python">True</code>)

 <p>You can test the new function manually in the <b>Expression</b> pane by passing in 
    <code class="csharp">exampleCells</code><code class="python">example_cells</code> 
    as the first parameter, then any cell number in the range 0-399. Then run the automated tests.</p>
