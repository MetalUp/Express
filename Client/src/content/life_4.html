<p>The function written previously,<code class="csharp">AdjustedNeighbourCells</code><code class="python">adjusted_neighbour_cells</code> and
    the functions that that depends upon have now been added into the background code. 
    You can either call it from the <em>Expression pane</em> or from within any other function that you write. </p>

<p>The next task is to detemine, for a given cell, how may of its neighbours are alive. This will be needed (in a <i>subsequent</i> task) to determine whether a cell lives or dies in the next generation.</p>

<p>So, write a new function named <code class="csharp">LiveNeighbours</code><code class="python">live_neighbours</code>, 
    which defines two parameters in the order given below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A list of Boolean values, named <code>grid</code></li>
        <li>The cell number (an integer) of interest</li>
    </ul>
 </p>The function should return an integer representing the number of the cell's neighbours (out of 8) that are currently alive (have the value <code class="csharp">true</code><code class="python">True</code>)

 <p>You can test the new function manually, in the Expression pane, by passing in <code>grid1</code> as the first parameter, then any cell number in the range 0-399. Then run the automated tests.</p>
