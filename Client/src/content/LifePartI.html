<p>When developing an application using the <i>functions first</i> approach, it is possible to work top down, or bottom up. 
    We are going to take the latter approach: we shall start by writing a small, key, function that we know will be required somewhere in the application
     and then build a richer function that makes use of it, and so-on until we have completed the core functionality.</p>
     <p>Your first task, then, is to define a function – named <code class="csharp">WillLive</code><code class="python">will_live</code> – that determines whether a single cell will be alive in the next ‘generation’.</p>
        <p>The rules of, Life state that:</p>
        <ul>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
<li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
        </ul>
<p>These rules can be evaluated from two input values, which should be defined as parameters for <code class="csharp">WillLive</code><code class="python">will_live</code>, in the order given here:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Boolean parameter – named alive – specifying whether the cell itself is currently alive (true) or not (false)</li>
<li>An integer parameter – named neighbours – specifying the number of neighbouring cells (out of a maximum of 8) that are <i>currently alive</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="csharp">WillLive</code><code class="python">will_live</code> should return a Boolean value: true if the cell will be alive in the next generation, false if it will be dead.</p> 
<p>Your task is to implement this function, returning a single expression that embodies all three of the rules above.</p>
