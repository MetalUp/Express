<p>In Life we will need to know about the <i>neighbours</i> of a cell. Including the diagonals, a cell has <i>eight</i> immediate neighbours.</p>

</p>Write a function named <code class="csharp">NeighbourCells</code><code class="python">neighbour_cells</code>
that defines one parameter named <code>c</code> - an integer value representing a specific cell number - and returns a list of eight integers representing the cell numbers of
its eight neighbours. For example, knowing that the width of the grid is 20:</p>

<ul>
<li>The neighbour to the <i>right</i> of <code>c</code> is <code>c+1</code></li>
<li>The neighbour <i>above</i> <code>c</code> is <code>c-20</code></li>
<li>You'll need to work out the values for the other six neighbours and return them all as a list. 
(The ordering within the list is not important, but you should specify them in some sensible order.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This algorithm will work for most of the cells, including those at the left and right edges of the grid (which wrap around),
but if we apply it to cells in the top or bottom rows, some of the values returned values will be outside the range 0-399.
That's OK for now - we'll deal with it in the next task.</p>
