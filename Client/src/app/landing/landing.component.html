            <p>MetalUp.Express is an online 'Integrated Learning Environment' for programming, in several different

            <h3>Using the system</h3>
            <p>To use MetalUp.Express you will need to be registered as a Student or a Teacher (see below).
                If you are <i>already</i> registered, then please <b>Log In</b> to use the system.
                (If you are <i>not</i> already registered then just logging in still won't get you access to any of
                content.) Clicking the <b>Log In</b>
                button will generate a pop-up managed by the 'Auth0' service. This will allow you to log in using your
                Google, GitHub, or othe recognised credentials,
                but <i>once you have registered <i>please always log in using the same credentials</i>, as these will be
                    associated with your User profile.
                </i></p>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-margin" (click)="registeredService.login()">Log In</button>
        </ng-container>
